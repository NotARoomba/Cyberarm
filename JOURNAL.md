This is my journal of the design and building process of **Cyberarm**.

## 10/16/2025 - Planning  

I want this arm to have a base that rotates on one axis, then a joint where it can rotate on 2 axis, then another joint where it can rotate on another 3 axis, and finally the toolhead where it has another 3 axis (maybe just one???). In total this adds up to a robot that has 9 degrees of freedom which is insane and also pretty cool considering that it isn't just limited to just one configuration.

(IDK kinematics but I've always wanted to learn so yea...)

Also as this being my first "major" hardware project involving CAD, I will be using (learning how to use) Inventor to create most of the design. It will be 3D printed and painted Cyberpunk-y but also if the money allows it, in the future I would use metal as the main material.

I plan on this arm being lightweight and also capable of moving objects and maybe even itself. Also battery powered and leverage Power Delivery from USB-C.

I also want this robot to be able to talk and also be able to listen so will need to add a speaker and microphone and use an MCU that has internet support. Also would like it to be able to connect to an external camera for it to be able to "see" it's surroundings and allow it to move wherever I pit my hand.

I'll first start off by researching chips/modules that allow for speech recognition and also for camera input. I would only need 2 cameras for this because I would use one camera for X/Y and another for X/Z.

Board specs:

- ESP32-S3-WROOM-1: Has WiFi + Bluetooth and also works for speech recognition
- BQ24170/2 or BQ25713: Multi cell Li-ion/LiPo battery charging
- TPS25751DREFR: USB-C Power Delivery
- ICS-43434: Microphone
- MAX98357: Speaker
- PCA9685: motor control

- MG996R: Servos, might need 6-9

After researching a bit more, I will just keep the speaker and microphone on the board and have the cameras connected to my computer using a web server or something. The board should be in charge of doing everything including interfacing with the tool head modules. I plan on the arms being attached modularly through a snapping mechanism that's easy to take apart, the same for the tool head. 

Here is a sketch of what I have in mind:

I saw somewhere that to fix the problem of spinning circuits, they made a PCB "ring" where the no matter the rotation, it will always be connected. Further research shows that these are called "pancake slip rings". THey will supply 5V, 3V3, and also an SPI/I2C channel to communicate with the tool hand. In the future I am also planning on having one section dedicated as a hardware ID so that it can automatically determine what module is connected (maybe through hardware bit flags???).
